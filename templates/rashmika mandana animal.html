            <p>After much anticipation and excitement, the much-awaited Bollywood film &quot;Animal&quot; has already taken the box office by storm. The film, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and produced by Bhushan Kumar, has managed to sell over 1,11,000 tickets for its opening day.

The frenzy around &quot;Animal&quot; is not surprising, considering the stellar cast it boasts. The film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Parineeti Chopra, Anil Kapoor, and Bobby Deol in lead roles. This power-packed ensemble has left fans and critics eager to witness the magic they will bring to the screen.

The film&#x27;s advance booking, which opened on Saturday, saw an overwhelming response from the audience. Within a short span of time, more than 1,11,000 tickets were sold, indicating that &quot;Animal&quot; is set to be a massive hit at the box office. This strong start has further heightened the anticipation surrounding the film.

&quot;Animal&quot; marks a collaboration between director Sandeep Reddy Vanga and actor Ranbir Kapoor for the first time. Both have previously delivered successful films, with Vanga helming the critically acclaimed &quot;Kabir Singh&quot; and Kapoor establishing himself as a versatile actor with a string of hit movies.

The plot of &quot;Animal&quot; has been kept under tight wraps, adding to the excitement and intrigue surrounding the film. The teaser released earlier this year offered glimpses of intense drama, powerful dialogues, and captivating performances, leaving fans wanting more.

With such tremendous advance bookings, it is evident that &quot;Animal&quot; has struck a chord with the audience even before its release. The film promises to deliver an edge-of-the-seat cinematic experience, combining powerful storytelling, outstanding performances, and gripping emotion.

As the release date approaches, fans are eagerly counting down the days to witness this highly anticipated film on the big screen.

In conclusion, &quot;Animal&quot; has created a frenzy among moviegoers, as evidenced by the staggering number of tickets sold in advance booking. With its star-studded cast, talented director, and intriguing storyline, this film is poised to be a blockbuster hit. The audience&#x27;s anticipation for &quot;Animal&quot; is at an all-time high, and the film&#x27;s success at the box office seems imminent.</p>
