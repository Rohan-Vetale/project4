            <h2> Alia Bhatt cheers for husband Ranbir Kapoor after watching Animal trailer; says her ‘mind is officially blown’ </h2>

            <p>In a recent interview, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga revealed an interesting tidbit about working with Ranbir Kapoor on their upcoming film, Animal. Vanga stated that Kapoor did not want the term &quot;superstar&quot; to be attached to his name on the film&#x27;s poster.

Vanga, who is known for his previous hits like Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy, is collaborating with Kapoor for the first time in Animal. The film has already generated a lot of buzz and anticipation among fans, mainly because of the talented individuals involved in its making.

During the interview, Vanga applauded Kapoor for his humble and down-to-earth nature. He mentioned that Kapoor didn&#x27;t want to be labeled as a &quot;superstar&quot; on the film&#x27;s poster, as he believed that the audience should decide whether he&#x27;s truly deserving of such a title or not. This showcases Kapoor as someone who values the audience&#x27;s opinion and wants to let his work speak for itself.

Vanga&#x27;s revelation about Kapoor&#x27;s choice to detach the term &quot;superstar&quot; from his name is a refreshing departure from the usual practice in the Indian film industry. Often, actors are associated with grandiose titles like &quot;superstar&quot; to enhance their popularity and market value. However, Kapoor&#x27;s decision to let go of this label is indicative of his commitment to authentic storytelling and his desire to be judged solely on his performance.

This move by Kapoor also reflects a growing trend in the industry where actors are embracing more relatable and realistic characters, rather than always playing larger-than-life figures. By detaching himself from the &quot;superstar&quot; label, Kapoor is paving the way for a more diverse and nuanced portrayal of characters onscreen.

Animal, which also stars Parineeti Chopra and Anil Kapoor, is an intense drama that revolves around the concept of a dark and gritty battle for power within a family. The film is expected to showcase the raw emotions and edgy performances that Vanga is known for.

As fans eagerly await the release of Animal, Ranbir Kapoor&#x27;s decision to distance himself from the &quot;superstar&quot; tag on the film&#x27;s poster only adds to the intrigue surrounding the project. It is a clear statement that he is focused on delivering a remarkable performance without relying on external labels.

In a world where social media and celebrity culture often dictate an actor&#x27;s image, Kapoor&#x27;s choice to detach himself from the &quot;superstar&quot; label is both refreshing and admirable. It showcases his dedication to his craft and his willingness to let the audience decide his true status as a performer.

Whether or not the audience will indeed crown Ranbir Kapoor as a superstar after the release of Animal remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain – his talent and his willingness to break free from conventional norms make him an artist to watch out for.</p>
